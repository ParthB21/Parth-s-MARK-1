# Parth-s-MARK-1

This is my first hackpad. It includes 4 switches, 1 rotary encoder and 1 OLED Display. The main MCU is Seeed XIAO RP2040. I would like to thank ScottoKeebs for providing some of the symbols and footprints.
I deliberately chose to not create an upper case for a techno-look.

I used KiCad for the PCB design, OnShape for the CAD design and VSCode for the KMK firmware.
