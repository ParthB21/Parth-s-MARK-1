# Parth-s-MARK-1

## Edit: this repository has been edited after feedback to include the BOM in CSV format and a Top case.

This is my first hackpad. It includes 4 switches, 1 rotary encoder and 1 OLED Display. The main MCU is Seeed XIAO RP2040. I would like to thank ScottoKeebs for providing some of the symbols and footprints.

Note: The colors in the images are for easier differentiation between the top and the bottom case and are not the actual colous of the 3D printed parts.

I used KiCad for the PCB design, OnShape for the CAD design and VSCode for the KMK firmware.
